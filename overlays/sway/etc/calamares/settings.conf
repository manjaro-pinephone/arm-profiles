# Modules can be job modules (with different interfaces) and QtWidgets view modules.
# They could all be placed in a number of different paths.
# "modules-search" is a list of strings, each of these can either be a full path to a
# directory or the keyword "local".
# "local" means LIBDIR/calamares/modules with settings in SHARE/calamares/modules or
# /etc/calamares/modules.
