# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create the file
# ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf and add your custom commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.

# Which viewmode should be used?  Possible values are:
#     miller: Use miller columns which show multiple levels of the hierarchy
#     multipane: Midnight-commander like multipane view showing all tabs next

# Which script is used to generate file previews?
# ranger ships with scope.sh, a script that calls external programs (see
# README.md for dependencies) to preview images, archives, etc.

# Use the external preview script or display simple plain text or image previews?

# Set the preview image method. Supported methods:
#
# * w3m (default):
#   Preview images in full color with the external command "w3mimgpreview"?
#   This requires the console web browser "w3m" and a supported terminal.
#   It has been successfully tested with "xterm" and "urxvt" without tmux.
#
# * iterm2:
#   Preview images in full color using iTerm2 image previews
#   (http://iterm2.com/images.html). This requires using iTerm2 compiled
#   with image preview support.
#
# * urxvt:
#   Preview images in full color using urxvt image backgrounds. This
#   requires using urxvt compiled with pixbuf support.
#
# * urxvt-full:
#   The same as urxvt but utilizing not only the preview pane but the
#   whole terminal window.
